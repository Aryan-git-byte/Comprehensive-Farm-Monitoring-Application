# ‚úÖ AI Testing Checklist - Quality Assurance

## üéØ Test Each Response for These 10 Mandatory Elements

Use this checklist to verify that the AI provides comprehensive, accurate advice:

---

- [ ] Timing: "Apply at 21 DAS" or "Top dress at Day 50"

**Bad Example**: "Water when needed"  
**Good Example**: "Irrigate when soil moisture drops below 40% (critical for wheat)"

---

## 3. ‚úÖ Specific Fertilizer Products

- [ ] Product name mentioned: Urea, DAP, MOP, etc.
- [ ] NPK ratio provided: "Urea 46-0-0" or "DAP 18-46-0"
- [ ] Quantity specified: "60 kg/ha"

**Bad Example**: "Add nitrogen fertilizer"  
**Good Example**: "Apply Urea (46-0-0) at 60 kg/ha, provides 27.6 kg nitrogen"

---

## 5. ‚úÖ Irrigation Method Recommendation

**What to Check**: Specific irrigation system suggested?

- [ ] Method named: Drip / Sprinkler / Flood / Furrow
- [ ] Water saving mentioned: "Saves 40-60% water"
- [ ] Crop suitability: "Best for tomatoes" or "Suitable for wheat"

## üîç Common Issues to Watch For

### Issue 1: Generic Advice

**Problem**: "Add fertilizer to improve growth"  
**Solution**: "Apply Urea (46-0-0) at 60 kg/ha at tillering stage (Day 25-30)"

### Issue 2: Missing Economics

**Problem**: "Use drip irrigation"  
**Solution**: "Drip irrigation costs ‚Çπ80,000-100,000/ha but saves 50% water and increases yield 20-30%"

### Issue 3: No Regional Context

**Problem**: Same advice for Punjab and Kerala  
**Solution**: "In Punjab's alkaline alluvial soils..." vs "In Kerala's acidic laterite soils..."

### Issue 4: Vague Thresholds

**Problem**: "Water when dry"  
**Solution**: "Irrigate when soil moisture drops below 40% (use finger test: soil doesn't form ball)"

### Issue 5: Contradictions

**Problem**: "pH is 5.0 (acidic but acceptable)"  
**Solution**: "pH is 5.0 (too acidic for wheat - optimal 6.0-7.5). Apply 2-3 tons/ha agricultural lime"
